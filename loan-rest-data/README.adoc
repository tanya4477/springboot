== Created a domain object

The domain object is loan.

The `Loan` has a loanAmount and a loanTermMonths. There is also an id object that is configured to be automatically generated so you don't have to deal with that.

== Created a Loan repository

This repository is an interface which allows to perform various operations involving `Loan` objects. It gets these operations by extending the CrudRepository.

At runtime, Spring Data REST will create an implementation of this interface automatically. Then it will use the @RepositoryRestResource annotation to direct Spring MVC to create RESTful endpoints at `/loan`.

Here also defined a custom query to retrieve a list of `Loan` objects based on the loanAmount and the loanTermMonths. We'll see how to invoke it further down in this guide.

== Make the application executable

`src/main/java/com.tanya.loan/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com.tanya.loan/Application.java[]
----
Spring Boot automatically spins up Spring Data JPA to create a concrete implementation of the `LoanRepository` and configure it to talk to a back end in-memory database using JPA.

Spring Data REST builds on top of Spring MVC. It creates a collection of Spring MVC controllers, JSON converters, and other beans needed to provide a RESTful front end. These components link up to the Spring Data JPA backend. Using Spring Boot this is all autoconfigured.

Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.


== Test the application

Now that the application is running, it can be tested. You can use any REST client you wish or it can be tested by using `curl`. The following are some of the `curl` examples.

First you want to see the top level service.

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080
{
  "_links" : {
    "loan" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/loan"
    },
    "profile" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/profile"
    }
  }
}
```

Here you get a first glimpse of what this server has to offer. There is a **loan** link located at http://localhost:8080/loan.

NOTE: Spring Data REST uses the http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL format] for JSON output. It is flexible and offers a convenient way to supply links adjacent to the data that is served.

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/loan
{
  "_embedded" : {
    "loan" : [ ]
  },
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/loan"
    },
    "profile" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/profile/loan"
    }
  }
}
```

== CREATE
There are initially no elements. Time to create a new `Loan`!

```
$ curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{  \"loanAmount\" : 100000,  \"loanTermMonths\" : 12 }" http://localhost:8080/loan 

HTTP/1.1 201 
Location: http://localhost:8080/loan/3
Content-Type: application/hal+json;charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Sun, 19 Feb 2017 22:53:57 GMT

{
  "loanAmount" : 100000.0,
  "loanTermMonths" : 12,
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/loan/1"
    },
    "loan" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/loan/1"
    }
  }
}
```

== READ

From this you can read for all loan:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/loan
{
  "_embedded" : {
    "loan" : [ {
      "loanAmount" : 100000.0,
      "loanTermMonths" : 12,
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/loan/1"
        },
        "loan" : {
          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/loan/1"
        }
      }
    } ]
  },
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/loan"
    },
    "profile" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/profile/loan"
    }
  }
}
```

You can read directly for the individual record:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/loan/1
{
  "loanAmount" : 100000.0,
  "loanTermMonths" : 12,
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/loan/1"
    },
    "loan" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/loan/1"
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE: This might appear to be purely web based, but behind the scenes, there is an H2 relational database.

== UPDATE

From this you can directly update an individual record:
```
$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{ \"loanAmount\" : 200000,  \"loanTermMonths\" : 36 }" http://localhost:8080/loan/1
{
  "loanAmount" : 200000.0,
  "loanTermMonths" : 36,
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/loan/1"
    },
    "loan" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/loan/1"
    }
  }
}
```
From this you can partially update an individual record:
```
$ curl -X PATCH -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{ \"loanAmount\": 150000}" http://localhost:8080/loan/1
{
  "loanAmount" : 150000.0,
  "loanTermMonths" : 36,
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/loan/1"
    },
    "loan" : {
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/loan/1"
    }
  }
}
```

== DELETE

From this you can directly delete an individual record:
$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/loan/1
